        <h1>Member Guidelines</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program</h2>
        <p>
            This program is a transformative movement built upon the foundation of Messiah Jesus. It aims to empower believers and non-believers alike through the truth of the Gospel, revealing Almighty God as ABBA—the God who delivers from slavery and bondage (<span class="highlight">Exodus 20:2</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the principles of sowing and reaping, financial freedom, and community empowerment, this program serves as a Kingdom-driven initiative to transform lives, restore families, and inspire dreams. Guided by the Holy Spirit, ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program is an invitation to experience God's abundant love and provision, creating a storehouse that reflects His goodness to all who participate.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faithful Stewardship:</strong> Members are encouraged to steward the blessings of this program in alignment with Kingdom principles. By sowing generously and reaping abundantly, participants will experience financial freedom and the joy of giving that brings glory to God.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Commitment:</strong> As a member, you are part of a thriving social community dedicated to uplifting one another. This program fosters collaboration, encouragement, and testimonies of God's work, ensuring that all members are supported and empowered.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Conduct:</strong> Members are expected to communicate in love and in alignment with the truth of Jesus Christ. Any communication contrary to the message of the Kingdom, including divisive or harmful speech, will be blocked to protect the integrity of the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Empowering Non-Believers:</strong> Non-believers are welcomed to participate in the program for passive income opportunities. However, it is our prayer that through this program's social environment and the Spirit of ABBA, they will encounter Jesus' love, experience the Holy Spirit, and come to faith in Him.</li>
            <li><strong>No Termination of Membership:</strong> Membership in ABBA's Kingdom Donation Program is not terminated based on financial struggles. Instead, the program is designed to empower and uplift every participant. If challenges arise, members will receive Holy Spirit-led assistance, including incentives and support to help them achieve passive income.</li>
            <li><strong>Continual Access:</strong> Once a member joins, they will always have access to the program. Even in seasons of struggle, the program remains an investment into each member's life, providing tools and resources to overcome difficulties and grow in faith and provision.</li>
            <li><strong>Guardrails for Alignment:</strong> While the program is inclusive, it is also guarded to ensure that its mission and focus remain centered on Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God. Any actions or communications that detract from this focus will be addressed in a spirit of love and correction.</li>
            <li><strong>Testimonies and Growth:</strong> Members are encouraged to share their testimonies of God's goodness as they engage with the program. These testimonies not only bring glory to ABBA but also inspire and encourage others in their faith journey.</li>
            <li><strong>Aligned with ABBA's Mission:</strong> This program is rooted in the truth of <span class="highlight">John 10:10</span>, where Jesus promises abundant life. By participating, members are declaring their belief that all things are possible through faith in Christ and aligning themselves with ABBA's mission to deliver His children from bondage into freedom.</li>
        </ul>
